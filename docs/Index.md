# Video Editor — Documentation

Obsidian-style vault. Open the `docs/` folder as a vault (or just read the
markdown); `[[wikilinks]]` connect the notes. Written for two readers: people
working on the app, and coding agents that need the reasoning behind it.

## Ground rules

- "Video Editor" is a placeholder name — [[Renaming]] lists every site.
- The owner reads history to learn *why*: commits are small, one intention
  each, and docs land in the same commit as the code ([[Conventions]]).
- What we learn about the products we imitate (CapCut, VEGAS, Premiere,
  Resolve) and the platforms we run on (WebCodecs, WebView2, Tauri) is
  written down in `research/` so nobody pays for a lesson twice.

## Map of content

- [[Architecture]] — layers, how an edit becomes pixels, the module table
- [[Conventions]] — where code goes, rules of thumb, commits, testing
- [[History]] — the build story, round by round, including rejected attempts
- [[Renaming]] — every site the placeholder name touches, and the one that
  moves user data

## Research

- [[CapCut desktop]] — the UX baseline: layout, every panel, shortcuts,
  export, what users complain about
- [[Professional NLE features]] — VEGAS, Premiere and Resolve depth: trim
  modes, J/K/L, keyframes, color, audio, formats, interchange
- [[Web media engine]] — mediabunny, WebCodecs, WebGL2, Web Audio,
  ffmpeg.wasm and on-device AI in the browser, with pitfalls
- [[Tauri desktop media]] — serving media to the webview, the frame pipe to
  ffmpeg, ffmpeg packaging and licensing, WebView2 specifics
- [[AI and automation]] — AI features across editors, what runs locally, and
  the pipeline/agent API design

## Decisions (ADRs)

Every non-obvious choice gets a short Architecture Decision Record in
`decisions/`. Oldest first:

- [[ADR-001 Tauri v2 and React, the TermHQ stack]]
- [[ADR-002 The media engine lives in the webview]] — frames never cross IPC;
  Rust supplies bytes, proxies and masters
- [[ADR-003 Desktop first, one build, a platform seam]] — all compute on the
  user's machine; web is a client-only subset
- [[ADR-004 Timeline time is integer frames]] — rational fps, SMPTE timecode
- [[ADR-005 One store, snapshot undo]] — useSyncExternalStore, drags as one
  undo step
- [[ADR-006 Every edit is a named command with a JSON Schema]] — the agent
  and MCP surface
